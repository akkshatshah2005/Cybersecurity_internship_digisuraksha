# 🔐 Digisuraksha Cybersecurity Internship – 8-Week Practical Journey (2025)

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Internship repository, showcasing an intensive **8-week hands-on journey** through the realms of offensive security, threat intelligence, and incident response. This internship emphasizes real-world learning using frameworks and platforms such as **MITRE ATT&CK**, **MISP**, **YARA**, **Burp Suite**, and **Graylog**.

## 📆 Weekly Breakdown

### 🔹 Week 1 – MITRE ATT&CK & Threat TTP Mapping
- Mapped APT tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) using the MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Created and validated custom **YARA rules**
- Exported threat indicators and signatures to **MISP**
- 📸 Included relevant screenshots to document each step

---

### 🔹 Week 2 – Malware & IOC Analysis (APT28 Case Study)
- Investigated the **APT28** advanced persistent threat group
- Extracted **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** from threat intelligence reports
- Correlated and enriched IOCs using **HybridAnalysis** and **MISP**

---

### 🔹 Week 3 – Linux Privilege Escalation
- Completed **OverTheWire: Bandit** CTF for foundational Linux access skills
- Practiced multiple **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)** techniques
- Compiled custom **cheat sheets** with verified commands and example outputs

---

### 🔹 Week 4 – OSINT & Reconnaissance
- Performed **metadata extraction**, reverse image search, and geolocation tracking
- Used a suite of tools for passive intelligence gathering:
  - `theHarvester`, `SpiderFoot`, `Maltego`, etc.
- Explored real-world OSINT workflows with practical examples

---

### 🔹 Week 5 – Web Exploitation & Vulnerability Testing
- Identified and exploited common web vulnerabilities:
  - ✅ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - ✅ **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
  - ✅ **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
- Utilized **PortSwigger Web Academy** and **Burp Suite** for vulnerability analysis and payload crafting
- Performed **log analysis** to detect suspicious web activity

---

### 🔹 Week 6 – Vulnerable Virtual Machine Walkthroughs
- Conducted full walkthroughs and captured flags in:
  - 🖥️ **Mr. Robot VM**
  - 🧠 **DC-1 VM**
- Documented step-by-step exploitation process from initial access to root

---

### 🔹 Week 7 – Log Analysis & Incident Response
- Used **Graylog** to query and visualize system logs
- Reconstructed a simulated attack timeline using log artifacts
- Created an **Incident Response (IR)** checklist and reporting templates

---

### 🔹 Week 8 – Finalization, Documentation & Review
- Compiled all artifacts, screenshots, and findings into a comprehensive internship report
- Peer-reviewed submissions for feedback and clarity
- Finalized GitHub repository structure for public showcasing
